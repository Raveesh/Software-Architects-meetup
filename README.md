# Software-Architects-meetup
Meetup of Software architects

5 things every Software Architect should know . <br>
A good Product is successful when its released in the market and easily maintainable.  <br>
1. Who Is your Actual customer ? <br>
2.Learn a new Language ( Business Domain Language . Desirable to have a thorough business domain knowledge) <br>
3."Perfect" vs "Good enough"  --> Do not aim for perfection !!! . Aim for "Good enough" solution and stop when you have achieved it. ( Just enough Architecture) <br>
4.Architectural Trade-offs --> Architecture Tradeoff Analysis method. (ATAM)  <br>
		--> CBAM (Cost benefit ANalysis method)  <br>
		--> Communicate impact.  <br>
		--> Fulfilling every requirement leads to unstable architecture <br>
		--> You cant have it all. <br>
5.Great software is not built , it is grown. (Walking skeleton :)) . Have a grand vision , not grand design <br>


Should the artchitect know the "Why" every time ?  <br>
walking skeleton, but not the first time ??  <br>
